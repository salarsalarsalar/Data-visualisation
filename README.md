# Data Visualization

## üìä Project Overview

This project serves as a collection of practice tasks focused on visualizing using D3.js. The primary goal is to explore and understand the capabilities of D3.js for creating dynamic, interactive, and custom data visualizations.

These tasks are designed to enhance skills in data binding, SVG manipulation, transitions, and interactive elements, making complex information accessible and engaging.

## ‚ú® Features

- **[Type of Visualization 1, e.g., Bar Chart]:** Demonstrates basic data binding and SVG rectangle creation.
    
- **[Type of Visualization 2, e.g., Line Chart with Tooltip]:** Illustrates rendering time-series data and adding interactive tooltips.
    
- **[Type of Visualization 3, e.g., Scatter Plot with Zoom/Pan]:** Explores relationships between variables and implements user interaction for navigation.
    
- **[Type of Visualization 4, e.g., Force-Directed Graph]:** Shows network structures and simulates physical forces.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

These D3.js practice tasks are typically run directly in a web browser.

1. **Clone the repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/salarsalarsalar/Data-visualisation
    cd Data-visualisation
    ```
    
2. Open the HTML files:
    
    Navigate to the project folder and open the index.html (or specific task-name.html) file(s) directly in your web browser. Most modern browsers will execute the D3.js code without needing a local server for simple files.
    
    - **Note:** For tasks involving loading external data (e.g., CSV, JSON) from your local file system, you might need a simple local web server due to browser security restrictions (CORS). You can use Python's built-in server:
        
        ```
        # In your project directory:
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        
        Then, open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` (or the relevant HTML file) in your browser.


## üèÉ Usage

Once you have opened the respective HTML file in your web browser, the D3.js visualization should render automatically.
